# Card-Master
This is a simple website creation project to get practice with Vue.js, as I am just learning how to create websites using Vue on the frontend!

## The Goal
The current goal is to attempt to create a dynamic website that loads cards that a user can create, delete, and do all sorts of stuff with! I will also document the journey I have taken creating this game, as a fun thing to look back on!
